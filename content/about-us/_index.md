  title: Why Supernova Exists
  quote: We orbit around your needs as all-star advisory teams.

    **The founders’ journey is innately challenging;** it’s why so few have the
    endurance to make it all the way through. Seeking and building a team of
    mentors to strengthen decision-making is a powerful way to increase the
    probability of success. Unfortunately, finding actual experienced startup
    advisors who can care for you and the mission is difficult. And if you do
    find them, how do you ensure that they are properly utilized and
    incentivized? <br/><br/>


    For decades, traditional advising for most founders and their companies has
    been essentially non-existent, or so informal and ad-hoc that it leaves
    something to be desired. Accelerators are mostly all focused on early-stage
    companies and Scaleups needs are super different. Boards can be helpful at a
    high-level, but rarely get hands-on to solve problems and implement
    solutions.

    **The perfect advisor does not exist**, but a dynamic team that adapts to
    your current company challenges, and knows what you are going through
    because they too have been a founder is “the perfect advisor.” <br/><br/>


    **Supernova is the future of startup advising.** We are the first and only
    resource able to curate successfully exited entrepreneurs and adapt that
    team to serve the evolving priorities and challenges of your company.
    <br/><br/>


    **Our mission is to accelerate the realization of the founder's vision**
    from the only perspective that truly understands the journey, as founders
    ourselves. Supernova is the future of startup advising.
