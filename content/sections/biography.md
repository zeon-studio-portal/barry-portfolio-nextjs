bio: >-
  Hi, I'm Barry - 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. <br /><br />

  As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead a private community of 150+ exited founders who
  invest, advise and mentor world-changing companies to achieve their missions,
  faster. My 25+ year career includes consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500,
  building a $315MM+ business at Acxiom as a global corporate innovation leader,
  and scaling my first startup to a $1.6B exit with Oracle. I co-founded 1heart,
  a human accelerator elevating 1000+ leaders' lives by expanding consciousness
  to solve planetary problems.<br /><br /> I'm here to serve and spark the
  mindset shift our future demands. At conferences, corporate events, and
  leadership retreats, my talks empower audiences to rise to the
  moment—unlocking access to our higher selves and superpowers. As the world
  evolves at hyperspeed, the demand for conscious leadership has never been
  greater. It's our time to shine by solving the pressing challenges of our time
  and play a greater game together.<br /><br />Let’s connect and co-create an
  unforgettable experience together.
